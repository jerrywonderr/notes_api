# Notes API
## Description
This is a simple API built on Node.js to help users create and manage notes. Basically, it's synonymous with an API-based backend of a note-taking application where users can create notes and perform basic CRUD operations on them. This API can be used for exactly just that, excusing the need to build out a full-fledged backend application to handle the notes. 

_*By the way, I have plans to niche this down to an API to manage tasks, that way, it will be more useful for frontend developers working on a simple task manager application. Yeah, so, be on the lookout if you're interested.*_
